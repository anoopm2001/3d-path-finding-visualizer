## Live Demo
The live demo can be found [here](https://dhruvmisra.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer-ThreeJS/).

## Features
### Weighted and unweighted algorithms
* **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** (weighted) <br>
The father of pathfinding algorithms, it creates a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex, the source, to all other points in the graph. <b>Guarantees</b> the shortest path!

* **A\* Search algorithm** (weighted) <br>
One of the best and a popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals with heuristic. <b>Guarantees</b> the shortest path!

* **Breadth-First Search** (unwighted) <br>
The algorithm starts at the tree root, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. <b>Guarantees</b> the shortest path!

* **Depth-First Search** (unwighted) <br>
The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. <b>Does not guarantee</b> the shortest path!

### Maze generation
Two methods to generate a maze:
* Recursive Division
* Random

### First-Person view
Roam around the world you create in First-Person view and watch the algorithm move under your feet!

### Device camera input
Turn on your device's camera to create the walls on the grid from the camera feed! Play around with any image that has some good contrast and see it replicated on the grid.
